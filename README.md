# ACM Research coding challenge (Fall 2022) by Reid Smith
My README description of my project for my ACM Research application

## My Goal

*TLDR:* I ended up focusing on determining the most cheap/expensive car colors, and how the way I sanitized the data would affect the results
## Code Description

## Results

## Sources
Apart from referencing Matplotlib and Python 3 documentation a lot to know what I could actually do, the only code I used that wasn't my own was the starting comments and imports that came with starting a new notebook on the "CarsForSale" Kaggle webpage.
